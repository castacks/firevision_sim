Exercises (documentation lesson)
================================

Before you start
----------------

- Discuss the exercise idea with the classroom.
- Distribute exercises among groups of 2-3 persons.
- Open a GitHub issue and inform the community about the problem and how you
  plan to solve it. Discuss why we do this.
- Fork this project.
- Commit to your fork. In your commit message auto-close the issue you have addressed.
- Submit a pull request.
- We then review the pull requests.
- After the pull requests are merged we verify that documentation updates itself.


Basic
-----

- Document the purpose of this example code.
- Document how to clone the code.
- Describe the project tree structure.
- Write a sentence or two about Zipf's law and link to Wikipedia
  (coordinate with the group working on the previous exercise).
- Document how to check the code style with ``pycodestyle``.
- Give other developers hints on how they can contribute to the documentation.
- Document how to build the documentation locally
  (coordinate with the group working on the previous exercise).
- Add an example output.
- Add an example plot
  (coordinate with the group working on the previous exercise).
- Document where/how to ask for help.
